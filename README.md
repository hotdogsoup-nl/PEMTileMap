**PEMTmxMap** creates `SpriteKit` game maps from TMX Map files. [TMX Map files][tmx-map-url] can be created and edited with [Tiled][tiled-url].

Based on the well-known [JSTileMap][jstilemap-url] project which was famously used in Ray Wenderlichs [SuperKoalio][superkoalio-url] project but no longer seems to be maintained. I hope to make a light-weight framework that supports iOS, macOS and tvOS.

## Features

- [X] both nearest neighbor and linear texture antialiasing
